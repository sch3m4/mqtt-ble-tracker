## MQTT Bluetooth Low Energy devices tracker

Altough this tool was made to reuse RPI/OSMC devices as BLE tracker, it can work on any Linux machine with a Bluetooth device.

## Description

This tool can be used as a room presence detector and tracker for BLE devices.

Every time a BLE beacon is received, it applies a Kalman filter to smooth the RSSI and reduce the noise to make the system more accurate.

## Prerequisites
- On Debian based machines:
```
apt-get install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-dev libglib2.0-dev build-essential git
```

- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sch3m4/bletracker.git
cd bletracker
```

- Install Python dependencies:
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

## General setup
Before running the BLE tracker, you need to configure some settings in `config.yaml`.

 - `scan_period`: BLE scanning interval.
 - `single_tracker`: Boolean to specify the [deployment type](#Single-tracker).
 - `mqtt.name`: Client ID to use when sending MQTT messages.
 - `mqtt.host`: MQTT Server.
 - `mqtt.port`: MQTT Port.
 - `mqtt.username`: MQTT Username.
 - `mqtt.password`: MQTT Password.
 - `mqtt.topic`: MQTT Topic used by this tracker device. **Note**: Depending on the integration, each tracker device should use a different topic (Home Assistant integration)[#Home-Assistant-integration].
 - `mqtt.qos`: MQTT QoS (see https://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/mqttdoc/MQTTClient/html/qos.html).
 - `mqtt.keepalive`: MQTT Keepalive. If no data has been transfered with the MQTT server after that value, client sends a heartbeat to the server.
 - `messages.include_location`: Boolean to specify whether include the name of the estimated location of the device in the MQTT message or not.
 - `messages.include_rssi`: Boolean to specify whether include the RSSI in the MQTT message or not.
 
## Including location names

By default, location names are not sent to the MQTT server, but you can include them by setting the boolean setting `messages.include_location` in `config.yaml` as specified in [General setup](#General-setup) and configuring the `locations` ranges.

### Defining locations

Locations are defined based on the distance between the tracker device and the tracked device.

To add a new location, follow this steps:
1. [Set up the tracked device](#Discovering-and-setting-up-your-devices)  in the `config.yaml` file.
2. Take the tracked device to the different locations you want to identify.
3. Write down the average values for `distance` reported by the tracker device on each location.
4. Set the distance ranges for each location in `config.yaml` under `locations` section as follows:
```
locations:
  livingroom:
    min_dist: 0
    max_dist: 5

  bathroom:
    min_dist: 5
    max_dist: 7

  bedroom:
    min_dist: 7
    max_dist: 10
```

Now, every time the tracker device reports the distance to any monitored device, it will include the location name.

**Note**: If there is no location in range, the `location` field will be set to `status_off`, as configured in the (device setup)[#Device-set-up].

## Discovering and setting up your devices
### Distance calculation
There are lot of different ways to **estimate** the distance to the BLE device, here we're using the formula:

```
distance = 10 ^ ( (MR â€” RSSI) / (10 * N) )
```

For the software to be able to calculate the distance to your device, you need to provide three parameters per each BLE device:
1. **RSSI**: Received signal strength indicator from the device to track
2. **MR**: RSSI at 1 meter away
2. **N**: Constant (depending on environment conditions)

### Discovering and adjustment

**IMPORTANT**: Before running any scan, take the BLE device 1 meter away from the BLE scanner device.

To discover devices as well as calculate the "**MR**" and the "**N**" constant, run the script with the following arguments:

```
python3 src/tracker.py --scan --device [device-mac-here]
```

***Note**: To see all the devices in range, remove the "--device [device-mac-here]" argument

Let that scan run for a while, and once the "distance" variable is close to 1 meter and "stable" between different samples, stop the scan by pressing "CTRL+C" and write down the "**MR**" and "**N**" variables.

Sample output:
```
ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe (BLE Device), RSSI=-67 dB, MR=-0.1671, N=4.90251674, Distance=23.08

ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe (BLE Device), RSSI=-67 dB, MR=-69.4929, N=2.10826675, Distance=0.76
ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe (BLE Device), RSSI=-67 dB, MR=-69.3228, N=2.10087613, Distance=0.78

ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe (BLE Device), RSSI=-70 dB, MR=-69.6756, N=2.01408935, Distance=1.04
```

In this case, let's write down:
 - **MR**: -69.6756
 - **N**: 2.01408935


### Device set up

In order to track the device, edit the file `config.yaml` and add the following under the `devices` section:

```
devices:
  - mac: ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe
    name: ble tag 1
    measured_rssi: -69.6756
    n: 2.01408935
    timeout: 0
    status_off: not_home
```

Fields description:
- `mac`: Device bluetooth mac address.
- `name`: Device name.
- `measured_rssi`: RSSI value 1 meter away from the tracker device (see: (Discovering and adjustment)[#Discovering-and-adjustment]).
- `n`: Constant to calculate the distance (see: (Discovering and adjustment)[#Discovering-and-adjustment]).
- `timeout`: If the device is not seen after this period of time (seconds), the tracker device sends a message with `'distance' : -1` to the MQTT broker (0 means disabled). If `message.include_location` is set to `true`, the location name  will be set to `status_off`.
- `status_off`: Location name when the device is untracked (due to timeout) or out of range from the defined locations.


## How to install
1. Move the project folder to your prefered location
2. Edit the `src/bletracker.service` and set the right paths to `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart`
3. Adjust your settings in `config.yaml`
4. Install the service
```
cp src/bletracker.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable bletracker
```
5. You're ready to go
```
systemctl start bletracker
```

## Home Assistant integration

There are two different ways to integrate this tracker with Home Assistant to detect room presence.

- [Single tracker](#Single-tracker)
- [Multiple trackers](#Multiple-trackers)

For Home Assistant, there is no difference. In order to enable presence detection you only have to add the following sensor:

```
- platform: mqtt_room
  name: ble tag 1
  device_id: ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe
  state_topic: bletracker
  away_timeout: 360
```

**Note**: The `state_topic` and `device_id` in Home Assistant must match the `mqtt.topic` and `devices.mac` in `config.yaml`.

[Home Assistant MQTT Room](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt_room/)

### Single tracker

Using only one tracker device to report the location of the tracked BLE devices.

- `single_tracker` setting must be set to `true` in `config.yaml`.
- Locations must be [configured](#Defining-locations).
- On presence notification, location name will be added to the `mqtt.topic`.
  - If `mqtt.topic` is set to `bletracker`, every time a device is tracked in a defined location a message will be sent to the topic `bletracker/[location_name]`).

### Multiple trackers

Using multiple tracker devices in diferent locations.

- `single_tracker` setting must be set to `false` in `config.yaml`
- `mqtt.topic` must be unique for each tracker device:
  - Tracker device of the livingroom: `topic: bletracker/livingroom`
  - Tracker device of the bedroom: `topic: bletracker/bedroom`
  - ...

## Message format

The simplest message structure is as follows:

```
{
  "id" : "ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe",
  "name" : "ble tag 1",
  "distance" : 1.04
}
```

If the tracker is configured to include the location name or the RSSI, two additional fields are included:

```
{
  "id" : "ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe",
  "name" : "ble tag 1",
  "distance" : 1.04,
  "location" : "livingroom",
  "rssi" : -64
}
```
